# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Summary:
This project is a simple tic tac toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking the spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Setup:
To run this project locally, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/demo-task.git
```

Then open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.

## Usage:
- Players can click on any empty space on the grid to make a move.
- The game alternates between Player X and Player O with each move.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.
- If all spaces on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Code Explanation:
1. The HTML structure contains a 3x3 grid of div elements representing the game board.
2. The CSS styles the game board and tracks the X and O markers using classes.
3. The JavaScript logic handles the game mechanics, including checking for a winner or a draw after each move.
